# üç¥ RESTful API MongoDB Project

## üìñ Project Description
Tattler is a database for managing restaurant information, designed as part of a project where users can register, rate, and comment on restaurants.  
This project uses **MongoDB** as the main database system.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation and Usage Instructions

1. Install MongoDB Community Server and MongoDB Compass.
2. Clone this repository in the command line:
   git clone https://github.com/Jesusale1234/RESTfulAPI.git
3. Use the MongoDB Compass CLI to create the database as follows:

   The name of the database should be: "tattlerprogramDB".

   The collection should be named "restaurants".
   I defined the following indexes:

4. The MongoDB database should be included correctly. Define the following text as a CSV file:
    name,category,location,rating
    Tacos Don Juan,Mexican,Mexico City,4.5
    Sushi Kyo,Japanese,Tokyo,4.7
    La Pizzeria,Italian,Rome,4.3

5. In the future, the use of a RESTful API related to the restaurants will be developed!
